# K2 MOC footprint files

This directory contains MOC files that encode the
sky coverage of past and future K2 Campaigns.

MOC is a HealPix-based VO standard file format
that is supported by the [Aladin interactive sky atlas](http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr).

These files were created by executing `python ../create-moc-files.py`.
